# event-planner-llm
This project is an AI-powered system that analyzes event posters and automatically generates creative event ideas and detailed event plans based on the poster content.
It uses multimodal models to understand images (posters) and large language models to reason, generate ideas, and create structured event plans.I used openrouter api key to call the free gemini-3-flash which was ranked the highest for image based analyses model.used streamlit to take user input from user and redirect the answers of the llm to the using in the interface and the overall ui design.
